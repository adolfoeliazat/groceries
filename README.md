### Groceries

A real-time, collaborative grocery list.

Front-end is built using React.js and the Flux pattern. Persistence layer terminology stolen from [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/), which the back-end architecture will eventually mimic.

### Usage

Requires [bower](http://bower.io/). I recommend you use a simple command-line tool like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to host in development.

```bash
  $ cd app
  $ bower install
  $ open index.html
```
